DRILL - Typing Tutor
=================

This is a typing tutor I wrote several years ago.  It supports qwerty and dvorak keyboards.  Others are easy to configure.

DRILL is written in C and has been tested on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

The program allows you to learn in levels with a limited group of keys at a time.  It embodies what I thought would be a good way to learn.  It is easily configured and extended.

The master copy of this system is located at:  https://github.com/blakemcbride/Drill
